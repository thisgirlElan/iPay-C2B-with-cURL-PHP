 Clone this repo:

```

git clone https://github.com/thisgirlElan/iPay-C2B-with-cURL-PHP.git

```
- Note: If you're not particularly keen with the JSON bit, you may alternatively use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) by simply copying the unique URL provided by them and pasting it on the ```cbk param``` or your own callback URL. This will allow you to see the callback in the original format, that is, as query params.

Dependencies (Optional)
- For you to be able to see the callback on your browser, I recommend using ngrok to create a tunnel for the application.

`` The ngrok way ``

You can install ngrok from here: [ngrok download](https://ngrok.com/download) and follow the guide (It short and straight-forward).

- If you had it installed, simply start your xampp as usual and run the following command to start a tunnel (Pretty sure you knew this already üòâ)

```
http ngrok 80
```

- Remember to have the codebase in htdocs.
- Copy the url that leads to the callback_payment.php file from the URL ngrok provides and update the cbk param in the payment_process.php file. e.g https://ngrok_url/test_script/callback_payment.php

When the server is up and running, open the `index.html` file on your browser.

### Good to Know

- The integration uses a simple HTML form for user input.
- Scripting has been done with PHP to fetch and render data.
- A separate PHP file has been used to extract the query params on the callback URL and convert to JSON.
- If you want to bypass the form filling, simply spin up the process_payment.php file. Amend what's needed from the comments on the file and you should be able to get it up and running.
